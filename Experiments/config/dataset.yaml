# Dataset Configuration
# This file contains global dataset configuration for train/val/test splits

# Path to the HDF5 dataset file containing the training data
# The dataset should contain time series data with state and input variables
h5_dataset_path: ${pkgfile:fmukf}/../../Experiments/data/Containerships_Large.h5

# Random seed for reproducible train/validation/test splits
# This seed determines which environments are selected for validation and test sets
# Same value needed for reproducibility of the benchmark and ML model training
seed: 69

# Number of environments to use for validation set
# These environments are excluded from training and used for model evaluation
num_envs_val:  100 #100

# Number of environments to use for test set
# These environments are excluded from training and validation, used for final evaluation
num_envs_test: 100 #100

# Time step size in seconds between each time step in the dataset
